 Online Bookshop Management System

✅ Introduction

An Online Bookshop Management System is a digital platform that allows users to browse, purchase, and manage books online. It automates the operations of a physical bookstore and provides an efficient way to handle books, authors, categories, orders, and customers using database-driven backend logic.

✅ System Components

1. Users Table

Stores customer data like username and email. It identifies who is placing the order.

2. Authors Table

Contains author information to avoid data redundancy and normalize the database.

3. Categories Table

Classifies books into genres like Fiction, Non-Fiction, Sci-Fi, etc.

4. Books Table

Stores the details of each book including title, author, category, and price.

5. Orders Table

Records each order placed by a user along with a timestamp.

6. Order_Items Table

Keeps track of the books included in each order and their quantities.

✅ Relationships Between Tables

Users → Orders: One-to-Many (One user can place many orders)

Authors → Books: One-to-Many (One author can write multiple books)

Categories → Books: One-to-Many (One category can include multiple books)

Orders → Order_Items: One-to-Many (Each order can contain multiple books)

Books → Order_Items: One-to-Many (Same book can appear in many orders)

✅ Technologies Used

Java: Programming language for console interface and backend logic

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For connecting and executing SQL queries

PostgreSQL: Relational database system to store and manage data

Multithreading: To perform background tasks like placing orders without blocking the UI

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): Modular design using classes and objects

✅ Key Features

Add/Edit books, authors, and categories

Place an order with multiple books (multithreaded)

View all orders with user and book details

Structured database management

Console-based menu interface

✅ Advantages

Centralized management of books and customers

Reduces manual effort for order handling

Scalable and customizable for real-world applications

Encourages good programming practices like OOP and transactions

✅ Disadvantages (Limitations)

Console-based interface is not suitable for real users

No login/authentication system

No GUI or web support

Not optimized for high concurrent users (no connection pooling)

✅ Conclusion

The Online Bookshop Management System is a simple yet effective way to simulate real-world bookstore operations using core Java, JDBC, and PostgreSQL. It introduces students and developers to key concepts in database design, multithreading, and OOP, and provides a solid base for further expansion into full-stack applications.
